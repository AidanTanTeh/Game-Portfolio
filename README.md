# 🎮 Interactive Portfolio Game

An interactive 2D side-scrolling personal portfolio built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.

Instead of a traditional website, I thought of creting a run-and-gun style shooter game to present my information. I was learning about simple 2D game design and creation through Youtube videos (link below) so I thought I would put it to practice by trying a hand at incorporating it into a personal portfolio.

Stuck to a theme of "Day and Night" which i incorporated into the changing background which transitions from sunrise to night. Also through this I have a new found respect for animators as drawing each frame for animations like the npm packages was fun but very frustrating at the same time.

PS: The text in the canvas environemnt with the billboards are kinda blurry. Still trying to find a way to fix this😅
